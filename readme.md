# necauqua-mod
This is a set of default configurations used by _me_ in my Minecraft mods,
all bundled as a single gradle plugin.

Most likely is has no use for you, at least because it has my name and domain
as well as other things hardcoded, but you can use this as a learning tool or
to understand how `build.gradle` files from my mods are so short and consise.

## Contribution
Well you can contact me if you find that something does not work right here
if it bugs you too much, but this thing is completely private and unusable without
forking it and changing hardcoded stuff anyway, so for yourself you might as well
fix/change anything

## License
This code is licensed under MIT, so you can freely reuse it if you want, I don't 
really care, it's pretty stupid anyway
